title: MotherBoard JCOM to DB9 female

Since there is a project to deploy an x86 VyOS as the router, After I install the system and I find out that I can use the console to connect to the system just like other Cisco(H3C) routers rather than using the screen.

However, The Cisco router are using RS232-RJ45 port, and I just spot that the H61 MotherBoard ais using jcom jumper to the DB9 male port. And my USB-RS232 converter is also with the DB9 male port, so I'd like to make a `jcom to DB9 female` plan.

I just find out some jcom and DB9 information here,

**As usual, when communicating via the RS232, a PC is as the `DTE`, but as I am using the PC being the router, it is becoming the `DCE`, so it's essential to switch the RXD and TXD.**

Finally, it works well with the Vyos Serial Console Mode.
